## About the Book
.NET is a programming platform that allows developers to write and run any type of application. Although the .NET platform officially supports many programming languages, C# is its main and the most popular language.
 
This book takes you through the fundamentals of .NET and provides a step-by-step guidance on building native applications that work seamlessly across multiple platforms. You will then get familiar with the fundamentals of relational databases and Entity Framework Core 7, including its code-first, database-first, and model-first approaches. Moving on, the book will introduce you to ASP.NET Core, the main framework on .NET that is designed for building web applications. You will also learn how to host and deploy Blazor WebAssembly using ASP.NET Core. In the subsequent sections, the book will teach you to set up bi-directional communication between the server and client using SignalR and enable gRPC communication on ASP.NET Core. Lastly, you will acquire the skills to manage and deploy your app with Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.

By the end of the book, you will be able to build cross-platform native apps with C# & .NET.
